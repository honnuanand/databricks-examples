# Databricks Examples and Learnings

This repository collects practical examples, patterns, and learnings from working with Databricks in real-world situations.

The goal is to provide:
✅ Reusable reference examples  
✅ Patterns to handle specific technical challenges  
✅ Small, focused modules you can apply or extend in your own Databricks environments

## 📂 Current Example Folders

### ➤ `Custom Libraries from ADLS Containers`

This example demonstrates:
- How to package a custom Python library as a `.whl`
- How to upload it to an ADLS container or DBFS

✅ Includes:
- Packaging scripts  
- Setup and usage notebooks  
- A clear README inside the folder

## 🚀 What’s Coming

I plan to grow this repository with examples covering:
- Advanced data engineering workflows  
- Streaming pipelines and structured streaming patterns  
- Unity Catalog best practices  
- Access controls, governance, and data lineage  
- MLflow and machine learning model management  
- Performance optimization and cost control techniques  
- Integrating external tools and systems with Databricks

Each folder will focus on a specific topic, with:
- Step-by-step notebooks  
- Scripts or configs as needed  
- Supporting README.md documentation
